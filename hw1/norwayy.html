                    Oslo is split into clear districts, each with its own character and charm. Previously, the great dividing line between east and west was the Akerselva, and in many ways it still is. The western side is known for its wide streets, entertainment and high housing prices, while the eastern side features small, cosy caf√©s and free outdoor areas.

                    Some districts are organised around the locals' heavy use of public transport, while others are more car-friendly Common to them all is easy access to most public facilities, such as libraries, schools and health services.
