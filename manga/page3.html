                        The human world, free from the threat of demons; 
                        and the demon world, where human breeding farms were set up to provide food for the demons.
                        Children had identifying numbers tattooed on them and had no knowledge of the outside world. 
                        They believed that they were orphans and once they reached a certain age or intelligence, 
                        they would be taken out for adoption, but were fed to high-ranking demons instead.
